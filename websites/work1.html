           <!-- Introduction -->
           <section id="inroduction">
                <p>The Tie Terminal is a powerful institutional-grade crypto data platform, offering a vast array of <strong class="strong"> market analytics, sentiment data, news aggregation, and sector insights</strong>. It’s a comprehensive desktop tool used by traders, analysts, and hedge funds to make informed investment decisions.

                   However, with crypto markets evolving 24/7, users needed a way to stay connected on the go. </p>
                    
                    
                    <p>The challenge? <strong class="strong">Translating a feature-rich, data-dense desktop experience into an intuitive, mobile-friendly product</strong>.
                    
                    As the product designer leading this initiative, my goal was to create a streamlined yet powerful mobile experience—one that maintains the depth of insights while optimizing for usability, engagement, and clarity on a smaller screen.</p>

            <!-- Challenge -->
            <section id="challenge">
                <h1>V1 Designs and Challenges</h1>
                
                
                <p>While the first design iterations were functional, early testing revealed key limitations in how users interacted with data on mobile. We realized that traders and analysts had specific workflows that weren’t fully reflected in the initial designs.</p>
                <img src="../websites/img/V1-Mobile.png" alt="first designs" class="casestudy-image">
                <img src="../websites/img/V1-Mobile-2.png" alt="first designs" class="casestudy-image">
                <img src="../websites/img/V1-Mobile-3.png" alt="first designs" class="casestudy-image">
                <p>Designing a mobile app for financial markets presents a unique challenge: how do you display complex, real-time financial data in a way that’s intuitive, readable, and engaging on a small screen? Here’s how we tackled these challenges:



                <p>

                    One of the biggest challenges in bringing The Tie Terminal to mobile was optimizing data-heavy screens without overwhelming the user. On desktop, traders can view multiple panels simultaneously on large screens. On mobile, we had to reimagine navigation, prioritize key insights, and simplify interactions to ensure a clear and efficient experience.
                    
                    </p><h1>Strategies to Overcome These Challenges</h1>
                    
                    <h3> Prioritizing Essential Data</h3>
                    
                    <p>Instead of cramming every metric from the desktop version, I worked closely with analysts, traders, and stakeholders to define the most impactful insights for mobile users. This included:
                       <ul><li><strong class="strong">Real-time market movers</strong> – Assets experiencing significant price or volume changes.</li>
                        <li><strong class="strong">Sentiment shifts</strong> – Tracking how social media and news sentiment evolves over time.</li>
                        <li><strong class="strong">Headline aggregation</strong> – Curating top news stories that impact the crypto market.</li>
                    	<li><strong class="strong">Historical trends</strong> – Simplified yet interactive charts for key assets.</li></ul></p>
                    
                    <h3>Implementing Progressive Disclosure</h3>
                    
                    <p>To avoid overwhelming users with information, I structured screens using layered content hierarchy:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Primary screens show high-level metrics (e.g., BTC dominance, total market cap).</li> 
                        <li>Tapping into assets reveals deeper insights (charts, sentiment, news impact).</li> 
                        <li>Interactive elements like expandable sections and swipe gestures allow users to engage further when needed. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Creating a Modular UI System</h3>
                    
                    <p>I designed card-based layouts that functioned as independent data modules. This allowed for:</p>
                      <ul><li>Easy scanning – Each card contained one core insight, making it digestible.</li>
                        <li>Customization – Users could pin assets, reorder sections, and toggle between views.</li>
                        <li>Visual engagement – Graphs, heatmaps, and icons provided intuitive data representation.</li>
                    </ul>  

                   <h3>Optimizing Data Visualization for Mobile</h3>
                    
                    <p>Dense tables and large dashboards don’t translate well to mobile, so I focused on:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mini interactive charts for quick trend analysis.</li>
                        <li>Heatmaps & color coding for at-a-glance scanning (green for gains, red for losses).</li>
                        <li>Smooth scrolling historical graphs for improved touch interaction.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

            <img src="../websites/img/Mobile.png" alt="Case study image 01" class="portfolio-image">
            <h3>Visual Engagement & Mobile Usability</h3>
            <p>Data-heavy screens run the risk of feeling overwhelming or static, so I focused on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong class="strong">Visual hierarchy </strong> – Used bold typography, iconography, and contrast to highlight the most critical numbers first.</li>
                    <li><strong class="strong">Microinteractions</strong> – Subtle hover, press, and transition animations made interactions feel responsive and dynamic.</li>
                    <li><strong class="strong">Theming for Accessibility</strong> – nsured proper contrast ratios and readability in dark mode (preferred by most financial users).</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Key Design Iterations & Reviews</h3>
           
            <ul>
                <li><strong class="strong">Refining the Market Movers Screen</strong> – Initial designs used dense tables—but they felt cramped. Switched to a grid-based layout with visual indicators (arrows, colors, and percentage change labels). Added quick filters for Top Gainers, Losers, and Most Traded to help users find relevant insights faster.</li>
                <li><strong class="strong">Improving Chart Usability</strong> – Early prototypes had cluttered graph legends—users struggled to toggle between metrics. Simplified with dynamic tooltips & pinch-to-zoom gestures for an intuitive touch experience.</li>
           
            </ul>
